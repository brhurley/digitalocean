This is a presentation that I created that will be given at the Spring Dallas User Group meeting 6/19/2013 at 7pm

Abstract:

Finding a good server to develop and deploy on doesn't have to be hard or expensive.  We will look at the options for deploying Java code on the net and review some of their good and bad points. However, I have found a cloud solution that fits exactly what I needed for some small Java based web sites for a very reasonable price.  Digital Ocean Cloud servers offer some very good performance, extremely fast SSD drives for the best price that I have found so far.  Here is a link to my presentation, files and notes that we will cover in the meeting. https://github.com/brhurley/digitalocean.git
